# Ansible-Development-Server

This project is to stand up a simple Ansible development server with the following baked into the build

* Vagrant build for the basic environments with dependencies built in
* Basic user creation script for making a new user
* Assigning them to the sudo group
* Creating the SSH keys
* Preparing the Ansible environment

Additional work will be done in the future for adding in playbooks and instructions for setting up different use cases.
